# Social Killers X Kerastase

This project is a web application built with **React 19**, **React Router 7**, and **Supabase**. It follows a modern development workflow with local Supabase instances running via Docker.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v20 or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn** (package manager)
- **Docker Desktop** (Required for local Supabase)
- **Git**
- **Supabase CLI** (Required for managing the local database)

### Installing Supabase CLI

If you don't have the Supabase CLI installed, you can install it via npm (macOS/Linux/Windows):

```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

Or via Homebrew (macOS):

```bash
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
```

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd social-killers-x-kerastase
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## ⚡️ Supabase Local Development

This project uses Supabase for the backend (Database, Auth, Storage, etc.). To develop locally, you need to start the local Supabase instance.

1. **Make sure Docker is running.**

2. **Start Supabase:**

   This command spins up all necessary Supabase services in Docker containers.

   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```

   _After a successful start, you will see the API URL, Anon Key, and other credentials in the terminal. Keep these handy._

3. **Stop Supabase:**

   When you are done working, you can stop the containers to save resources.

   ```bash
   supabase stop
   ```

4. **Reset Database (Optional):**

   If you need to wipe the database and start fresh (applying current migrations):

   ```bash
   supabase db reset
   ```

## 🛠 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project to store your environment variables. You can copy the provided example file and fill in your credentials (found after running `supabase start`).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env` file should contain:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-local-anon-key>
```

> **Note:** Variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to the client-side code in Vite.
