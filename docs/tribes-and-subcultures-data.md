## Next Steps / Implementation Todos

### 1. Apply Database Migrations (Samy - CTO)

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop must be running

**Apply migrations locally:**
```bash
# Reset local database and apply all migrations
npx supabase db reset

# OR apply just the new migrations
npx supabase migration up
```

**Verify the changes:**
```bash
# Check tribes
npx supabase db execute --query "SELECT name, subtitle FROM tribes ORDER BY name"

# Check keywords
npx supabase db execute --query "SELECT t.name as tribe, k.name as keyword FROM keywords k JOIN tribes t ON k.tribe_id = t.id ORDER BY t.name, k.name"

# Check brands
npx supabase db execute --query "SELECT t.name as tribe, b.name as brand FROM brands b JOIN tribes t ON b.tribe_id = t.id ORDER BY t.name, b.name"
```

### 2. Update Brand Logo URLs

All brands currently use placeholder URLs (`https://placeholder.com/brand-logo.png`).

**Action needed:** Replace with actual logo URLs either:
- Manually in Supabase Dashboard
- Via a new migration file
- Via seed script

**Brands that need logos:**
- Hermès, Cartier, The Row, Loro Piana, Aesop, Stella McCartney, SkinCeuticals, Goop Beauty, Chloé, Miu Miu, Serge Lutens, Maison Margiela, Ganni, Glossier, MAC Cosmetics, GHD, YSL Beauty, Tom Ford, Diesel, Gentle Monster

### 3. Update Moodboard-Brand Relationships

The `moodboard_brands` junction table will be empty after migration (since old brands are deleted).

**Action needed:** Re-populate the moodboard_brands relationships based on:
- Which brands should appear in which moodboards
- Business logic for brand-moodboard associations

### 4. Review Subcultures Table Schema

The remote database has `subtitle`, `dos`, `donts` columns on the `subcultures` table, but the new migrations add these to the `tribes` table instead.

**Decision needed:**
- Keep these columns on subcultures table (currently unused)
- Remove them via migration to clean up schema
- Populate them with subculture-level content

### 5. Update TypeScript Types

After applying migrations, regenerate TypeScript types:

```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > app/shared/types/supabase.ts
```

### 6. Test Application

**Verify:**
- Tribe selection flows work correctly
- Keywords are displayed properly
- Brand associations are correct
- Moodboard display works
- User result calculation works with new tribe structure

### 7. Deploy to Production

Once tested locally:

```bash
# Push migrations to remote
npx supabase db push

# OR let CI/CD handle it via GitHub Actions
git push origin main
```
